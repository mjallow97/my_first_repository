            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Greetings! My name is Muhammed Jallow. I currently live in Canada but am originally Gambian. I have also
                experienced living in other countries such as Kenya, Ivory Coast, and, Tunisia. I have Bachelors of
                Science degree in Biology from Queens University, but my journey has taken an exciting turn into the
                dynamic world of Tech.</p>
            <br>

        <h3>Transition into IT</h3>
        <p>During my fourth year at university, I discovered a keen interest in the evolving tech world. It was the
            world of Artificial Intelligence that captivated me and fueled my desire to transition into the tech
            industry. My entry point was as a consultant for startups leveraging Salesforce platforms. Here, I dabbled
            in HTML and CSS, collaborating with front-end developers to craft captivating marketing forms on Salesforce.
            This experience ignited a profound interest in pursuing a career as a front-end developer.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Professional Goals</h3>
        <p> By enrolling in the DTTP program, my primary objective is
            to acquire the essential skills to craft visually stunning web pages. This journey serves as a big stepping
            stone towards my broader ambition of evolving into a proficient full-stack developer.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>My hobbies include working out at the gym, playing soccer in a mens league, going to concerts, trying new
            restaurants , and DJing. I also enjoy playing video games, with FIFA being one of my favourites.</p>
